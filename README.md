# Text Classification (python_nb_sklearn_gaussian_naive_bayes)
This project contains various notebooks applying text classification using multipolynomial naive bayes, vectorization and gridsearch within a `jupyter notebook` environment. Execution of this project relies quite heavily on `sklearn` library from `python3`.

# Before you get started
Make sure you have a read or general understanding to the concepts and methods below before getting started;
- Understanding how to use jupyter notebooks
- Application of naive bayes model
- Train test split concept
- Cross validation
- Confusion matrices
- Text manipulation, vectorization, term frequency and inverse document frequency

# Installation
**Requirements**
- `sklearn`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `jupyter`

```sh
pip install jupyter pandas numpy sklearn
```
